# Movie Explorer

**Movie Explorer** is a modern React web application that allows users to discover trending, top-rated, and even lesser-known movies via the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API**. 

It features a modern, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS and enriches each movie’s details with AI-generated summaries via **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API**. Users can seamlessly search for films, view detailed information (with AI bullet-point summaries), and create a personal watchlist of favourite movies.

## Features

- **Search movies** - Find films by title with instant search-as-you-type filtering and suggestions.
- **AI-powered summaries** - View concise bullet-point summaries for each movie, generated by an OpenAI GPT-3.5 model based on the movie’s description.
- **Trending & top-rated** - Browse current trending movies and top-rated classics fetched in real-time from the TMDB API.
- **Advanced filtering** - Narrow results by genre, release year, or minimum rating, and sort the list by popularity, release date, or rating.
- **Watchlist** - Save movies to your personal watchlist with one click. The watchlist is stored locally and can be searched, sorted, exported to JSON, or cleared as needed.
- **Ratings at a glance** - See star-based viewer ratings (from TMDB) on each movie card, giving quick insight into a film’s reception.
- **Smooth UX** - Enjoy fast client-side routing with React Router, infinite scrolling of results (with virtualisation for performance), and subtle UI animations/transitions for a more engaging experience.
